# INTRODUCTION TO INFORMATION SECURITY AND CYBERSECURITY
## INFORMATION SECURITY VS CYBER SECURITY


## Information Security(infosec)
- Protection of *all forms of information* (digital or physical) from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction.
-  Broader - includes *data in any form* (printed, spoken, written, or electronic).
- Ensure *Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)* of information, regardless of medium.
- Data protection (physical & digital).
- Paper documents
## Cybersecurity
- Protection of "digital assets, systems, networks, and data" from cyberattacks originating through the internet or other digital means.
- Narrower - focuses specifically on "digital and network-based threats*.
- Protect *computers, networks, servers, and data* from online attacks, breaches, and malware.
- System and network defense (digital only).
## Simplified Understanding
  Information Security = Protection all kinds of information
- Digital + Physical

cyber security = Protecting digital assets 
- Internet + Network Systems

Inshort:
 Cybersecurity is a subset of information security
## example comparison
| Situation                                         | Infosec view                                     | 
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| a hacker steals computer database from a wwebsite | Concrned about "loss of confidentiality"         |
| employee prints confidential data and leaks it    | ** handled under infosec ** (physical data leak) |

## summary          
| point       | infosec            | Cybersecurity              |
|-------------|--------------------|---------------------       |
| Focus       | data(any form)     | digital environment        |          
| coverage    | broader            | subset of infosec          |
| threat type | Physical + Digital | Only digital               |
| GOAL        | CIA of all data    | CIA of all digital assests |
